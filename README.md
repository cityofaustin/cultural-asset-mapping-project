### About this repo
This repository is used to do three main things:
- Help collaborators understand the who/what/why of this project
- Keep project-related discussions and action items organized in one place
- Host an interactive web map to showcase the data collected before and during this project


### About the project's interative web map
The interactive web map used in this project is built using the super awesome  [Searchable Map Template](http://derekeder.com/searchable_map_template/) created by [Derek Eder](http://derekeder.com) in Chicago. More information about how the original template was created, as well as how to use it for your own projects can be found [here](https://github.com/derekeder/FusionTable-Map-Template). The license for Searchable Map Template can be found  [here](https://github.com/derekeder/FusionTable-Map-Template/blob/master/LICENSE).
